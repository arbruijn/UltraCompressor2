rem GENERAL
rem    This is an archive expansion batch file for the
rem    UltraCompressor II (automated) archive conversion
rem    option. The batch file accepts a single parameter,
rem    the full path of the file to be extracted. The batch
rem    expands the archive completely, including system/
rem    hidden/readonly files and the complete diretory structure.
rem    The batch file should also create two files, U$~CHK1 and
rem    U$~CHK2, if EVERYTHING went completely OK. In case of
rem    problems, errors, etc., they should not be made.
