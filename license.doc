2.E DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS.
==============================

As the copyright holder, AIP-NL authorizes distribution by individuals
only in accordance with the following restrictions.

The package is defined as the entire file either as 'self extracting
executable' or an 'archive' as distributed by AIP-NL. The authenticity
of the package can be verified by contacting AIP-NL, or by running the
AIP-NL UltraSafe program which verifies the digital signatures AIP-NL
ALWAYS adds to all its distributed software. If the package is changed
in any way, distribution is forbidden. Please contact AIP-NL to
obtain a complete package suitable for distribution.

You are hereby granted permission by AIP-NL to copy the package for
your own use or for others to evaluate, ONLY when the following
conditions are met:

   The package - including all related program files and documentation
   files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed as a
   complete unchanged package, without exception.

   Small supplements to the package, such as the introductory or
   installation batch files, are acceptable. This should always be
   done by supplying EXTRA files, never by altering the package (file)
   as distributed by AIP-NL.

   No price or other compensation may be charged for the package. A
   distribution cost may be charged for the cost of the diskette,
   shipping and handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not
   exceed US$ 15. In case ANY compensation is charged, the receiver
   should be notified, in writing, of his obligations concerning the
   Trial Use License.

   AIP-NL prohibits the distribution of outdated versions of the
   package, without written permission from AIP-NL. If the version
   you have obtained is over six (6) months old, please contact AIP-NL
   to ensure that you have the most current version.

   The package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive
   package, nor can it be included in any commercial or non-commercial
   software packaging offer, without a written agreement from AIP-NL.

   The package, program(s) or documentation cannot be 'rented' or
   'leased' to others.

   If you wish to add any of our packages to a CD-ROM or other
   collection, please check the release date of the version you have.

   have the most current version of the software. Only current
   versions may be shipped as 'Disk-of-the-Month' disks.
