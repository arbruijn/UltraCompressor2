0.G USING UC.EXE STAND ALONE, WITHOUT THE ACCOMPANYING FILES.
=============================================================

This paragraph does not really belong in this document, but it is the
most likely place people who want to get rid of the *.DOC, *.BAT etc.
files will look.

If you use UC.EXE stand alone you can not:
   - use the document viewer            (needs *.DOC)
   - use archive conversion             (needs U2_XTRA, CHECK, EX???.BAT)
   - use ensure mode                    (needs U2_FLUSH.BAT)
   - show multimedia banners            (needs U2_SHOW.BAT)
   - use the $PRF (print files) command (needs U2_PRINT.BAT)
   - use the R (revise comment) command (needs U2_EDIT.BAT)
   - use any of the tools (ORDER, VM, US, UCDIR, etc.)

To use UC.EXE stand alone, in the configuration menu you should:
   - set the reliability level (C) to detect or protect
   - switch 'Show (multimedia) banners' (H) to off
   - (perhaps) disable the logfile (U)
   - set the 'temporary files' (S) to a common directory (or use UC2_TMP)

Other than this, everything works without needing the extra files.
