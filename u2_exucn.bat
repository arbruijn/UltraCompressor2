rem U2_EXUCN.BAT accepts a single parameter: an archive file. It
rem decompresses all files (including hidden ones, etc.) of this archive
rem completely into the current directory. If nothing goes wrong, the files
rem U$~CHK1 and U$~CHK2 are created by this batch file. UC tests for the
rem presence of those files.

rem The '%2 ~*' command checks if files/directories are present in the
rem current directory (to check if anything at all has been extracted
rem from the archive) and creates the u$~chk1 file if this is the
rem case. %2 contains the full path of UC.EXE.

rem Notice that UCN files are handled just like UC2 files. The purpose is
rem to allow "conversion" from UCN to UC2 of files. The conversion may
rem include several operations you want to perform. (e.g. adding banners,
rem virus scanning)

rem 1. UC

   rem Create second check file to notify complete success to UC

      echo check > u$~chk2
