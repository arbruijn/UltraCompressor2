1.A WHAT IS ULTRA COMPRESSOR II?
================================

UltraCompressor II from Ad Infinitum Programs (AIP-NL) is an
archiver. An archiver is a file handling and compression utility. It
will make most of your files significantly smaller and it can keep
related files together. When you need the files, you can decompress
them with the same UC utility. UC is very easy to use, thanks to its
simple user interface and has support for all archiving needs.

An archive behaves just like a floppy disk. It has a directory
structure, you can copy from the archive with extraction and copy to
the archive by adding. It is also possible to delete files from the
archive.

UC can also make such an archive DAMAGE PROTECTED, so ALL files in the
archive are safe, even if there are disk errors (within reasonable
limits).

With UC an archive can contain multiple versions of the same file.

With a clear manual and a limited number of commands, UC will turn out
to be very easy to use. Most of the options are configurable, so the
commands are very simple and easy to remember.

In general UC is very fast, especially when updating archives or
extracting files from archives. At the same time it has superior
compression. UC can handle near unlimited collections of files, in
multi-gigabyte archives, even on an XT. For a detailed overview of the
features of UC, see paragraph C.

1.C ULTRA COMPRESSOR MAIN FEATURE OVERVIEW.
===========================================

Most topics refer to another part of the documentation where you can
get more information.

GENERAL FEATURES
----------------

 * BETTER COMPRESSION
        On an average 8%, but often above 60%, better compression than
        competing software.
        (See chapter 4 paragraph A options TF, TN, TT; chapter 6
        paragraph A.)

 * SPEED
        Compression is fast and configurable to favor compression speed
        or archive size. Extraction is very fast. UC is also very fast
        when it UPDATES an archive, even if this archive is large,
        stored on a network server or stored on a slow (floppy) disk.
        (See chapter 4 paragraph A options TF and I; paragraph F
        'smart skipping'; chapter 6 paragraph A.)

 * RELIABILITY
        Archives can optionally be protected against damage, allowing
        them to recover from most disk-errors without any loss of data.
        UC always works 'transaction oriented' allowing recovery from
        most crashes without any loss of data. It has optional
        double-verification, preventing data loss in case of hardware or
        software problems.
        (See chapter 4 paragraph A the P command; chapter 6 paragraph
        A 'reliability level'.)

 * EASY TO USE (INTEGRATED HELP)
        UC has integrated help (with search) and an, easy to use,
        integrated configuration tool. Only a few commands are needed
        to manage archives with UC. UC can automatically deal with
        ARC, ARJ, LZH, ZIP etc. archives as if they are UC archives.
        (See chapter 3; chapter 6.)

 > ADVANCED VERSION MANAGEMENT  *** NEW ***
        Multiple versions of file collections (projects) can be managed
        with the included 'Version Manager' (VM) tool. VM supports
        project level version labelling.
        (See chapter 8 paragraph A.)

 * FULL SUPPORT OF OS/2 2.X EXTENDED ATTRIBUTES
        OS/2 2.x extended attributes (such as icons, WPS long icon
        names, WordPerfect 5.2 for OS/2 summary information etc.) can
        be kept in an archive. They are managed automatically.
        (See chapter 6 paragraph A 'Store OS/2 2.x extended
        attributes'.)


BUSINESS USE
------------

 * SCRIPTS
        A 'script' file can contain a large list of files (e.g. to be
        compressed). A script file can also be used as a substitute
        for multiple (complex) commands. Scripts can be nested, to
        allow the construction of 'building blocks'. Scripts can be
        extremely long (multi-megabyte).
        (See chapter 4 paragraph F 'scripts'.)

 * CAPABLE OF HEAVY DUTY TASKS
        There is almost no limit to the amount of files in an archive
        or to the amount of files processed in a single command. Where
        some other programs get into trouble with more than 10,000
        files, UC can easily handle a much larger number of files. Even
        a simple PC-XT can (given time) handle this workload.
        (See chapter 7 paragraph A.)

 * ERROR HANDLING AND LOGGING
        UC has advanced error handling and logging. This is
        especially important when large collections of files are
        archived from shared (network) disks. In almost all cases UC
        allows you to solve severe problems and enables you to
        continue the operation.
        (See chapter 4 paragraph F 'superior error handling' and
         chapter 8 paragraph F.)

 * STATE OF THE ART ENCRYPTION
        UltraCrypt (a separate AIP-NL product) can protect your data
        with heavy duty enhanced-triple-DES (Digital Encryption
        Standard) encryption. Faster encryption is included as well.
        (UCRYPT is a separate tool with its own manual.)

 * STATE OF THE ART AUTHENTICITY VERIFICATION
        UltraSeal and UltraSafe, separate AIP-NL products, can help you
        protect your data against undetected changes (e.g. virus
        infections or data falsifications). They do not use 'security by
        obscurity', but they use digital signatures based on Lucas
        functions.
        (USAFE and USEAL are separate tools with their own manuals.)


PROGRAMMERS
-----------

 * FILE VERSION MANAGEMENT
        Multiple versions of a file (e.g. the MAY 2 21:33:18 and the
        MAY 3 02:17:22 version) can be kept in an archive. UC version
        management is very simple to use.
        (See chapter 4 paragraph E.)

 * VERY FAST UPDATES
        UC is very fast in updating large archives while maintaining
        superior compression and reliability. No complex commands or
        options are needed for this.
        (See chapter 4 paragraph A options TF and I; paragraph F
        'smart skipping'; chapter 6 paragraph A.)

 * TRIVIAL PATH MANAGEMENT
        With UC it is very easy to copy any set of files from anywhere
        on disk to anywhere in the archive and vice versa.
        (See chapter 4 paragraphs A and B, the # option.)

 > FILTER ON FILE CONTENTS  *** NEW ***
        Define a search string and only files containing this string
        will be printed, listed, extracted, added etc..
        (See chapter 8, paragraph E.)

 > FILTER ON ANYTHING ELSE  *** NEW ***
        Filter on date/time, attributes, if a file is newer, query for
        each file etc..
        (See chapter 8, paragraph E.)

 > PRINT FILES  *** NEW ***
        Print files using YOUR favorite printing tool/method.
        (See chapter 8, paragraph E.)


BBS SYSOPS
----------

 * MULTIMEDIA BANNERS
        UC allows you to add multimedia banners (text, graphics, sound
        and music) to an archive, or to a collection of archives.
        (See chapter 5 paragraph B.)

 * EASY CONVERSION COMBINED WITH VIRUS SCANNING
        UC can convert collections of archives of almost any kind with
        just one simple command. If preferred, UC will scan archive
        contents for viruses during conversion.
        (See chapter 5 paragraph A.)

 * GET RID OF VIRUSES FOREVER
        The industrial strength authenticity verification software (see
        'business use') can help you to get rid of viruses forever by
        protecting archives against unauthorized changes.
        (USAFE and USEAL are separate tools with their own manuals.)

 * NEEDS ONLY 32KB FREE MEMORY TO RUN
        UC can be used together with other large programs, perfect for
        mailers and other (large) programs that need to call UC.
        (See chapter 5 paragraph C.)

 > TIME STAMP  *** NEW ***
        Time stamp (collections of) archives with the date/time of their
        newest file.
        (See chapter 8, paragraph E.)
