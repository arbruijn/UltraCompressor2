rem U2_EXLZH.BAT accepts a single parameter: an archive file. It
rem decompresses all files (including hidden ones, etc.) of this archive
rem completely into the current directory. If nothing goes wrong, the files
rem U$~CHK1 and U$~CHK2 are created by this batch file. UC tests for the
rem presence of those files.

rem The '%2 ~*' command checks if files/directories are present in the
rem current directory (to check if anything at all has been extracted
rem from the archive) and creates the u$~chk1 file if this is the
rem case. %2 contains the full path of UC.EXE.
