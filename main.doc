4. MAIN: the use of the UC command in detail
============================================

UltraCompressor II (tm) from Ad Infinitum Programs (AIP-NL) is an
archiver. An archiver is a file handling and compression utility. It
will make most of your files significantly smaller and it can keep
related files together. When you need the files, you can decompress
them with the same UC utility. UC is very easy to use, thanks to its
highly developed user interface, and has support for all archiving
needs.

All details on ordering UltraCompressor II are built into ORDER.EXE.

One general point about UC is that you can consider an archive in the
same way as you would a disk. It has a root directory, sub-directories
and so on. UC always contains the full directory structure. With UC,
you do not have to deal with 'match path', 'store full path', 'junk
directory name' etc..

The file extension of UC archives is currently .UC2. In the future, if
a major new version of UC is released, the extension will become .UC3.
This means that there can be no confusion about which version of UC
should be used.

While using UC, the screen will indicate whether everything is working
properly. When errors occur they are shown in detail on the screen and
are also written to an error-log file. When this error-log file grows
over 25,000 bytes, UC will give a warning.

In this document all commands/options in the examples given are in
upper case, and parameters are always in lower case. In use, however,
the case is never important. Any mix of upper and lower case can be
used.

4.A COMMAND/OPTION SUMMARY.
===========================

General: UC command [option(s)] archive-name [files]

Starting UC with no commands at all, starts the MANUAL VIEWER and
CONFIGURATION MENU.

Commands:
---------
   A D E     ADD/DELETE/EXTRACT files to/from archive.
             (See paragraph B and C.)

   L V       LIST/VERBOSE LIST contents of archive.

   P         make archive DAMAGE PROTECTED (approx 1% overhead). Once
             an archive becomes damage protected, it remains damage
             protected, even if it is altered. The P command can be
             combined with other commands (e.g. AP).

   U         remove damage protection (if present) from archive.

   T         fully TEST archive. When it is damaged, UC will ask if
             it needs to be repaired. In force mode (see options), UC
             will repair without asking.
             If an archive is repaired 100% this is reported. If the
             archive cannot be repaired 100%, the problems (such as
             which files are still damaged, etc.) are reported on
             screen and in the error-log file.

   C         CONVERT ZIP, ARC, ARJ etc. archives to UC archives.
             (See chapter 5 paragraph A.)

   O         OPTIMIZE archive can make an archive even smaller without
             deleting anything from the archive. Especially if an
             archive has been updated many times and/or contains many
             versions (revisions) of specific files, optimize can
             significantly reduce the size of an archive.

   R         REVISE archive comment.
             (See paragraph D.)

Options:
--------
   Options can be concatenated to the command (UC ES arch) or they can
   be prefixed by a - or / (UC E -S arch).

   TF TN TT  Type-Fast; Type-Normal (default) or Type-Tight/multimedia
             compression.

             In TT mode, UC will detect whether a file is a multimedia
             file. Special (lossless) multimedia compression will then
             take place.

             Please note multimedia compression is not able to
             compress already compressed files (e.g. *.GIF or *.JPG
             cannot be significantly compressed).

   TST       Type-Super-Tight compresses a bit better that TT
             compression, but takes noticeable more time. Only
             recommended if time is not an issue. TST compression does
             not affect decompression speed, which remains very fast.

   S         also process all SUB-DIRECTORIES. By default only the
             files in the current directory are processed.

   M         MOVE mode, after addition/extraction the used source files
             are deleted. UC assures the addition/extraction completed
             successfully before it deletes the source file.

   F         FORCE mode. Using this mode, the program will work
             silently. Almost nothing will be asked during execution.
             In all cases where a question would be asked, the program
             acts as if 'yes' was answered. When not using this mode,
             the program will often ask what you want in case of doubt.

                when NOT in force mode
                ----------------------
                   - UC will prompt you before overwriting files
                   - UC will prompt you before creating directories
                   - UC will optionally ask if hidden/system files
                     should be processed
                   - UC will optionally ask permission to convert
                     archives
                   - UC will optionally ask permission to show/play
                     multimedia banners
                   - UC will prompt you before repairing a damaged
                     archive (T command)

                when in force mode
                ------------------
                   - UC will overwrite files without asking
                   - UC will create directories without asking
                   - UC will add hidden/system files (unless
                     the configuration does not allow that)
                   - UC will always apply auto-conversion
                   - UC will show/play multimedia banners (unless
                     the configuration does not allow that)
                   - UC will repair an archive immediately, if
                     the T (test) command finds a problem

   I         INCREMENTAL mode, for FAST updates and version control.
             Version control is also called revision management. The
             original archive is not changed, changed files are
             appended to the archive. Previous versions (revisions) of
             a file remain accessible this way (version control).
             (See paragraph E.)

   B         BASIC mode (default unless UC is configured otherwise).
             This is the opposite of incremental mode. In basic mode
             UC overwrites files in the archive. No former versions of
             a file are kept in the archive. If there are multiple
             versions of a file only the latest one is overwritten in
             non incremental mode.

   !         EXCLUDE file(s).
             (See paragraph B.)

   ;n        extract/delete OLDER VERSION of file
             (See paragraph E.)

   !DTT=YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS
             DYNAMIC TIME TRAVEL, option for accessing older versions
             (revisions) of (large) collections of files.
             (See paragraph E.)

   #         DESTINATION PATH of files in archive while adding or
             DESTINATION PATH of files on disk while extracting.
             (See paragraphs B and C.)

   ##        Like #, but the specified source path(s) will be appended
             to the destination path.

   &         CONCATENATION OF COMMANDS.
             (See paragraph D.)

   @         specifies a SCRIPT which substitutes part of the command
             line.
             (See paragraph F.)

   !@        like @, but puts '!' before all entries (useful to
             exclude a collection of files)

   !RELIA=   These options allow (temporary) CONFIGURATION of many of
   !ARCON=   the values one can configure with the configuration
   !SMSKIP=  screen. The exact usage of these options is documented
   !BAN=     in chapter 6.
   !VSCAN=
   !SOS2EA=  Example: UC A -S !SYSHID=ON arch *.*
   !NET=
   !SYSHID=  In this example hidden and system files are also added to
             the archive.


4.B ADDING FILES, LISTING CONTENTS.
===================================

Examples:

   UC A arch *.cpp
      All *.cpp files in the current directory are compressed into the
      archive arch.uc2. If the archive already exists, the files are
      added to the archive.


   UC A -TF docs *.* !*.bak
      All (*.*) files except *.bak files are (RAPIDLY) compressed into
      the archive docs.uc2.

   UC A -S a:\back c:\doc\*.*
      Create/update archive of complete directory with its
      subdirectories to archive back.uc2 in the root directory of
      drive A:.

   When the files to be added are specified with *.*, the command can
   be shortened: 'c:\doc\*.*' can be replaced by 'c:\doc\'. This also
   applies to the exclude file(s) option.

   UC A -S a:\back c:\doc\ !c:\doc\old\
      All files in c:\doc and its subdirectories (except for files in
      c:\doc\old and its subdirectories) will be added to back.uc2.

   UC A -M arch *.bat
      All *.bat files will be moved from the current directory to the
      archive arch.uc2.

   UC A arch #\dir1 *.cpp
      Add all .cpp files from the current directory to directory dir1
      in the archive arch.uc2. When a subdirectory does not already
      exist in the archive, UC will ask you if it has to be created in
      the archive.

   UC A arch tools\*.c drivers\*.drv
      The *.c files from the tools directory and the *.drv files from
      the drivers directory are added to the root directory of the
      archive.

   UC A arch tools\*.c drivers\*.drv ##
      The *.c files from the tools directory are added to the tools
      directory in the archive, the *.drv files from the drivers
      directory are added to the drivers directory in the archive.

   UC A arch tools\*.c drivers\*.drv ##specials
      The *.c files from the tools directory are added to the
      specials\tools directory in the archive, the *.drv files from
      the drivers directory are added to the specials\drivers
      directory in the archive.

   UC L arch
      List contents of root directory of arch.uc2 without
      subdirectories.

   UC V arch
      Verbose list contents of arch.uc2 without subdirectories. Not
      only the files are shown, but also all the versions of the
      files, with date and time of last update.

   UC L -S arch
      List contents of all directories and subdirectories in arch.uc2

When you have a file whose name starts with #, !, @ or & you have to
let UC know that you are referring to a file (and not to something
else):

   UC A arch .\#file
      Add #file to arch.uc2. The .\ prefix is used to ensure that the
      filename is not interpreted as destination path.


Possible alternative ways to enter commands
-------------------------------------------
   Options can be put directly after the command or after the previous
   option (no space allowed) or they can be prefixed by '-' or '/'.

   Some example alternatives for 'UC A -S -TF docs *.* !*.bak':

      UC  A -STF docs *.* !*.bak

         You can concatenate options.

      UC  ASTF docs *.* !*.bak

         You can append the options directly to the command.

      UC  -A -S -TF docs *.* !*.bak

         It is allowed to precede the command with an '-'.

      UC  A /S /TF docs *.* !*.bak

         UC does not care whether you use '-' or '/'.

      UC  A -S -TF docs !*.bak

         If no file specifications are present, UC uses *.*.


If you want an archive with a name without extension, type a '.' just
after the archive name:

   UC A sources. *.*
      The archive will become 'sources' instead of 'sources.uc2'.


4.C EXTRACTING FILES.
=====================

Examples:

   UC E sources *.cpp
      Extract all *.cpp files from sources.uc2 into the current
      directory.

   UC E backup \test\test.cpp
      Extract test.cpp from subdirectory test in the archive, into
      the current directory.

   UC E -S backup \test\*.*
      Extract contents of the archive's directory test and all its
      subdirectories, into the current directory.

   UC E -S backup \test\*.* #\dir1
      Extract contents of the archive's directory test and all its
      subdirectories into the directory \dir1.

   UC E -M arch *.bat
      All *.bat files will be moved from arch.uc2 to the current
      directory.

  UC E arch tools\*.c drivers\*.drv
      The *.C files from the tools directory and the *.drv files from
      the drivers directory are extracted into the current directory.

   UC E arch \tools\*.c \drivers\*.drv ##
      The *.c files from the tools directory are extracted into the
      tools directory beneath the current directory, the *.drv files
      from the drivers directory are extracted into the drivers
      directory beneath the current directory.

   UC E arch tools\*.c drivers\*.drv ##\
      The *.c files from the tools directory are extracted into the
      tools directory in the root directory, the *.drv files from the
      drivers directory are extracted into the drivers directory in
      the root directory.

   UC E arch tools\*.c drivers\*.drv ##\specials
      The *.c files from the tools directory are extracted into the
      \specials\tools directory, the *.drv files from the drivers
      directory are extracted into the \specials\drivers directory.


   When a directory does not exist, UC will ask you if it has to be
   created.

   UC D arch *.bak
      Delete all *.bak files from the archive.

   UC D arch *.* !*.dbf !*.ntx
      Delete all files except *.dbf and *.ntx files from the archive.


4.D OTHER COMMANDS AND OPTIONS.
===============================

Examples:

   UC T arch
      Thoroughly test arch.uc2, and if it turns out to be damaged,
      prompt the user for reparation of the archive.

      In case the archive is repaired, a new archive is created with
      the name FIX_xxxx.UC (xxxx stands for the sequence number of
      existing FIX files), the original arch.uc2 remains unchanged.

   UC P arch
      Makes arch.uc2 damage protected.

   UC U arch
      Remove damage protection from arch.uc2.

   UC C arch.arj  or
   UC C arch.zip  or
   UC C arch.lzh  etc.
      An archive made with another archiver will be converted to a UC
      archive. The extension (e.g. zip, arj) is optional; UC will read
      'UC C arch' as 'UC C arch.*'.

      Note: be sure the other archiver you need is in a directory
      named in the PATH statement of your AUTOEXEC.BAT.


   UC A one *.bat & A -S world *.bak & E -S exec *.exe & A world *.cmd
      With '&' multiple commands can be given at once.

      In this command all the .bat files from the current directory
      are added to one.uc2, all the .bak files from the current
      directory and all its subdirectories are added to world.uc2, all
      the .exe files from the archive (including subdirectories) are
      extracted from exec.uc2 and all the .cmd files from the current
      directory are added to world.uc2.

   For long commands we advise you to use '@'.
   (See paragraph F.)

   UC R arch
      With your favorite editor you can view or edit the comment file
      in the archive arch.

      Note: be sure your U2_EDIT.BAT file is accessible and contains
      your favorite editor.
      (See chapter 6 paragraph D.)


4.E VERSION MANAGEMENT.
=======================

When you want to keep the former versions (revisions) of a file in
the archive, you can use the -I option to activate 'incremental mode'.

You can use the -B option, to activate 'basic mode', when you do not
want to keep the older versions of a file in the archive.

In the configuration screen (see also chapter 6) it is possible to
change the default mode from basic mode to incremental mode or vice
versa.

In the next examples the default mode of UC is basic:

   UC A -I -S a:\back c:\docs\*.*
      Incrementally update an archive (a:\back.uc2)

   UC E arch filename.doc
      Extracts the most recent version of the file 'filename.doc'
      from arch.uc2.

   UC E arch filename.doc;n
      Extracts the requested version of the file 'filename.doc'.
      'n' represents the number of the version.

Some explanation about 'n':
---------------------------
   Different versions of the same file in the archive get a sequence
   number.

   The most recent version gets number 0. The oldest version gets the
   highest number. Every time the same file is added to the archive in
   incremental mode, to remain consistent, all versions get a new
   number.

   There is no practical limit to the number of versions of a file you
   can keep in an archive.

Now we will look at an archive arch.uc2 after completion of some
operations:

   UC A -I arch test.doc
      The file test.doc is added to the archive arch.uc2. This is the
      first operation on the archive, so it contains only test.doc.

   UC V arch
      The verbose list of arch.uc2 shows us:
        TEST    DOC        1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12
       (name    ext nr     length    date         time)

After changing the file test.doc, we add it again to arch.uc2:

   UC A -I arch test.doc
      The second version of the same file is added to arch.uc2. The
      archive now contains two files:

   UC V arch
      The verbose list of arch.uc2 shows us:
        TEST    DOC;0      1245      MAR-17-1993  12:26:26
        TEST    DOC;1      1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12
       (name    ext nr     length    date         time)

After adding some more versions of the file TEST.DOC, the verbose
list gives:

   UC V arch
        TEST    DOC;0      1356      MAR-17-1993  14:02:00
        TEST    DOC;1      1349      MAR-17-1993  13:50:56
        TEST    DOC;2      1298      MAR-17-1993  13:28:32
        TEST    DOC;3      1280      MAR-17-1993  13:15:42
        TEST    DOC;4      1245      MAR-17-1993  12:26:26
        TEST    DOC;5      1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12

Now there are six different versions in the archive of the same file
TEST.DOC.
When you want to extract the most recent one, type the next command:

   UC E arch test.doc    or
   UC E arch test.doc;0
      The most recent version of TEST.DOC is extracted from arch.uc2.

When you want to see another version you have to include the version
number in the command:

   UC E arch test.doc;3
      There are three more recent versions in the archive than the
      version extracted.

(Of course the archive is unchanged after extracting a file.)

Deleting a version from the archive is possible with the next command:

   UC D arch test.doc
      The most recent version of the file is deleted from arch.uc2.

The verbose list will give the next information:

   UC V arch
        TEST    DOC;0      1349      MAR-17-1993  13:50:56
        TEST    DOC;1      1298      MAR-17-1993  13:28:32
        TEST    DOC;2      1280      MAR-17-1993  13:15:42
        TEST    DOC;3      1245      MAR-17-1993  12:26:26
        TEST    DOC;4      1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12

Also an older version of the file can be deleted:

   UC D arch test.doc;2

The verbose list will give the next information:

   UC V arch
        TEST    DOC;0      1349      MAR-17-1993  13:50:56
        TEST    DOC;1      1298      MAR-17-1993  13:28:32
        TEST    DOC;2      1245      MAR-17-1993  12:26:26
        TEST    DOC;3      1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12

When you want to remove the total file TEST.DOC with all its versions
from the archive you type the following command:

   UC D arch test.doc;*

When you want to remove all the older versions from the archive but
keep the most recent one, you type:

   UC D arch test.doc;* !test.doc     or
   UC D arch test.doc;* !test.doc;0

When the archive contains more files with different versions and you
only want to keep the most recent version of these files, you type:

   UC D arch *.*;* !*.*       or
   UC D arch *.*;* !*.*;0

As you can see in the examples, for the most recent version of a
file, you can just type the file name without number, or the filename
with ';0'.

Dynamic Time Travel (!DTT=YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS)
----------------------------------------------
   Time travel simulates the status of the archive, as it was at the
   specified moment in the past.

   The above explanation and samples work excellently for a small
   amount of files, but not when large collections of files, all with
   many versions, are involved. For this the 'Dynamic Time Travel'
   option is the perfect solution.

   Time travel is only available for the extract (E) and the list (L
   and V) commands. Its syntax is !DTT=YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM:SS with YYYY
   being the year (e.g. 1993), MM being the month, DD being the day,
   HH being the hour (e.g. 21), MM minute, SS second. The year MUST be
   4 digits, all other numbers MUST be two digits.

   You can supply only the left part of the arguments, UC will fill in
   the rest:

   e.g. !DTT=1993-03-17 will be expanded to 1993-03-17/00:00:00
        !DTT=1991 will be expanded to 1991-01-01/00:00:00
        !DTT=1992-01-22/18 will be expanded to 1992-01-22/18:00:00

   Please note the -/:'s are optional, e.g. !DTT=19930317 can be used
   instead of !DTT=1993-03-17. (Actually UC ignores the -/:'s
   completely, their only purpose is to make the entered command more
   readable.)

   For the next two examples, assume the archive contains:

      TEST    DOC;0      1349      MAR-17-1993  13:50:56
      TEST    DOC;1      1298      MAR-17-1993  13:28:32
      TEST    DOC;2      1280      MAR-17-1993  13:15:42
      TEST    DOC;3      1245      MAR-17-1993  12:26:26
      TEST    DOC;4      1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12

   An example:
      UC E !DTT=1993-03-17/13:30 arch test.doc

   In this case a 'time travel' to 17 march 1993, 13:30 is executed.
   Since at that moment the 13:28:32 version of test.doc was the one
   last added to the archive, THAT version will be extracted.

   Another example:
      UC V !DTT=1993-03-17/13:20 arch

        TEST    DOC;0      1280      MAR-17-1993  13:15:42
        TEST    DOC;1      1245      MAR-17-1993  12:26:26
        TEST    DOC;2      1234      MAR-17-1993  12:24:12

   Note two versions have 'disappeared' and all other versions have
   got a new index.

   Please note Dynamic Time Travel NEVER alters the contents of
   an archive, it only creates a different viewpoint.

Important notes
---------------
   Especially where an archive has been updated many times and
   contains many versions of specific files, optimize can
   significantly reduce the size of an archive.

   A just optimized archive, which contains multiple versions of
   files, will often be only a little bit larger than an archive which
   contains only the last version of all files.

   Move mode only moves the specified versions. If 6 versions of test.c
   are present in arch.uc2, then 'UC E -M arch test.c' will move
   test.c;0 and all other versions (5) will remain in the archive.


4.F FEATURES AND AUTOMATICS.
============================

Many advanced features are automatic in UC. The following topics are
covered in this paragraph:

   - Smart skipping

   - Superior error handling
   - Superior control-break handling
   - Ensure mode
   - Crash management

   - Auto-Conversion of other archives
   - Virus scan during conversion

   - Scripts
   - Wildcards in archives specification

   - OS/2 2.x extended attributes
   - Multimedia banners

Smart skipping
--------------
   Smart skipping means: Do not do unnecessary things. While updating
   an archive, files can be changed or not. Unchanged files will be
   skipped, when smart skipping is on. This makes updating faster.

   In the configuration, smart skipping can be on or off. UC compares
   filename, filesize, file time and file date.

Superior error handling
-----------------------
   No matter how deep UC gets into trouble, it will handle everything
   with grace.

   UC allows you not only to notice the error but also to do whatever
   is needed (including going to DOS!) to solve the problem. UC does
   not just stop, undoing all the work it has already done for you.
   E.g. when a floppy turns out to be write protected, you can remove
   the write protection and continue UC.

Superior control-break handling
-------------------------------
   When you interrupt UC, you do not just stop it, canceling all
   valuable work you have done. Instead, you are given the opportunity
   to go to DOS to do whatever you like (after which UC can continue
   where it left off). You can of course also abort the program.

   If you press control-break while UC is adding files to an archive,
   you get an extra option which allows you to skip all pending
   additions. All additions already performed, remain in the archive.
   (Since smart-skipping will automatically skip files which are
   already in the archive (when unchanged), you can continue the
   interrupted command later.)

Ensure mode
-----------
   For those who need absolute reliability, e.g. mission critical data
   compression tasks, UC has an ENSURE operation mode. In this mode UC
   handles all updates to an archive as transactions. A transaction
   can only be confirmed if PROOF has been gathered that the
   transaction was completed 100% without problems. When a problem has
   occurred, irrespective of the cause, e.g. hardware failures,
   software conflicts, they will never get by unnoticed and the
   operation can be reversed.

Crash management
----------------
   When adding files to an archive in basic mode, crashes can do no
   harm, because UC works with a temporary file. Only when everything
   has been completed successfully will the temporary file, which
   contains the new archive, be copied to the archive file. To prevent
   data loss while adding files to an archive in incremental mode, UC
   creates a new file with recovery information of the archive. This
   file is called arch.UR2 (UltraRecover).

   When everything goes right, this .UR2 file will be deleted
   automatically and you will never notice it ever existed. But when
   your computer crashes during adding files to the archive in
   incremental mode, this .UR2 file will mostly still exist after the
   crash.

   If you try to do anything with the archive now, you will get a
   message to repair the archive with 'UC T'. After the repair, the
   files arch.UC2 and arch.UR2 will still exist. The repaired archive
   is stored in the file named FIX_xxxx.UC2 (xxxx stands for the
   sequence number of existing FIX files). Before you can use the
   archive again, you have to move FIX_xxxx.UC2 to arch.UC2 and delete
   the file arch.UR2. Now the situation is similar to the one before
   the crash.

Auto-Conversion of other archives
---------------------------------
   Archives made by other archivers can be converted by UC. The
   automatic conversion can be set ON in the configuration (see also
   chapter 6 paragraph A option D).

   Adding a file to the archive or any other operation on it, starts
   automatically with the conversion of it. It is important to know
   that, when using an archive made with another archiver, you have to
   type the archive name with the extension (e.g. arch.zip, arch.arj).

   Note: be sure the other archiver you need is in a directory named
   in the PATH of your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Virus scan during conversion
----------------------------
   The archive to be converted can be optionally scanned for viruses.
   In the configuration this virus scanning can be switched ON or OFF.
   In the batch file U2_CHECK.bat some virus scanners are called. Make
   sure you have those virus scanners on your disk, in a directory
   named in the PATH of your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

   You can change the batch file and use different virus scanners (see
   chapter 6 paragraph D).

Scripts
-------
   A 'script' can contain a large list of files (e.g. to be
   compressed). A script can also be used as a substitute for multiple
   (complex) commands. Scripts can be nested, to allow the
   construction of 'building blocks'. Scripts can be extremely long
   (multi-megabyte).

   There are several ways to define a script. If you have entered
   '@exam' UC will look for:
      (1) an environment variable called EXAM_USC
      (2) the file 'exam.usc' (configured, current or PATH directory)
      (3) the file 'exam' (configured, current or PATH directory)

   UC @exam
      The contents of 'exam': A arch *.bat & V arch
      The .bat files are added to the archive arch.uc2 followed by a
      verbose list of arch.uc2.

      In this example multiple commands are concatenated by '&'.

   UC A arch @names
      The contents of 'names': *.bat *.cpp *.doc
      The .bat, .cpp and .doc files are added to the archive arch.uc2.
      In this example the files to be added are substituted by 'names'.

   UC @toback *.cpp
      The contents of 'toback': A c:\back
      All .cpp files are added to c:\back.uc2.

   UC @a arch *.cpp
      The contents of 'a': A -TST -SMSKIP=OFF -F
      This is an example of a 'personalized' add command.


   !@ works like @, but puts '!' before all entries. It can be used to
   exclude a collection of files.

   UC A arch *.* !@names
      The contents of 'names': *.bat *.cpp *.doc
      All files except .bat, .cpp and .doc files are added to the
      archive arch.uc2. In this example the files to be excluded are
      substituted by 'names'.

Wildcards in archives specification
-----------------------------------
   Instead of adding a file or a group of files to different archives
   in different commands, it is possible to work with wildcards.

   UC V *
      Gives the verbose list of all the archives at once.

   UC A * filename
      The file 'filename' will be added to all the UC archives in the
      current directory. Using a wildcard is the only way to access
      more archives in one command. Only one archive description is
      allowed in a command.

   UC A * *.cpp *.bas
      Of course more wildcards may be used for the files to be added.
      All .cpp and .bas files will be added to all archives in the
      current directory.

   The commands P, U, T, O and C accept multiple archive
   specifications. Here the archive specification cannot be confused
   with the files specification because there is none. Also for all
   these commands the -S option can be used to include archives in
   subdirectories.

   UC C *.zip *.arj *.lzh
      All zip, arj and lzh archives will be converted.

   UC T -S C:\*
      All archives on drive C: (including those in subdirectories)
      will be tested.

OS/2 2.x extended attributes
----------------------------
   When the option 'Store OS/2 2.x extended attributes' (see chapter 6
   paragraph A) is active, UC gets the capability to store OS/2
   extended attributes. For example if you attach an icon to a file,
   compress it and extract it somewhere else, the file will still have
   its icon. Of course this is only possible on an OS/2 machine. When
   you extract a file from an archive, the extended attributes will be
   the same as when you put the file in the archive. An archive
   optimized on a machine without extended attribute support (e.g. a
   plain DOS machine) will still contain extended attributes.

Multimedia banners
------------------
   Music, graphics and text banners can be added to an archive.
   (See chapter 5 paragraph B.)
