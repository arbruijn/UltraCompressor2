3. BASIC: the most essential commands of UC
===========================================

This document describes the most essential commands of UC. No special
features are mentioned. UC is very easy to use.

All details on ordering UltraCompressor II are built into ORDER.EXE.

This document contains the following paragraphs:

        - A. Decompressing a complete UC archive
        - B. Compressing a complete directory(tree) into an archive
        - C. Making an archive damage protected
        - D. Verbose list of the archive
        - Z. Summary

To jump to a certain paragraph, press the corresponding letter. To

See chapter 1 paragraph E for an overview of all documentation.


3.A DECOMPRESSING A COMPLETE UC ARCHIVE.
========================================

Command: UC ES archive-name

   Put the archive where you want the extracted files to be, and type
   the command UC ES archive-name, where 'archive-name' is the name of
   the archive (e.g. UC ES newstuff). All files in the archive will be
   extracted.

   UC ES works cautiously. It will never overwrite files, create
   directories etc., without first consulting you.


3.B COMPRESSING A COMPLETE DIRECTORY (TREE) INTO AN ARCHIVE.
============================================================

Command: UC A archive-name

   All files in the current directory are compressed into an archive
   (e.g. 'UC A mydocs' creates mydocs.uc2). If the archive already
   exists, only new and changed files are (re)compressed.

Command: UC AS archive-name

   The files in the current directory and ALL subdirectories are
   compressed into an archive (e.g. 'UC AS mydocs' creates
   mydocs.uc2). If the archive already exists, only new and changed
   files are (re)compressed.


3.C MAKING AN ARCHIVE DAMAGE PROTECTED.
=======================================

Command: UC P archive-name

   The archive will become damage protected and it will remain damage
   protected if you add files to it or delete files from it etc.. A
   damage protected archive can recover from most disk errors without
   losing ANY data. (The disadvantage of making archives damage
   protected is that the archives become a little bit larger).


3.D VERBOSE LIST OF THE ARCHIVE.
================================

Command: UC VS archive-name

   All files in the archive will be listed. The contents of all its
   subdirectories will be listed as well.


3.Z (BASIC) SUMMARY.
====================

UC ES name     EXTRACT all files from archive name.uc2

UC A  name     COMPRESS all files in current directory into name.uc2
UC AS name     COMPRESS all files in current directory AND its
               SUBDIRECTORIES into name.uc2

UC P  name     make name.uc2 DAMAGE PROTECTED

UC VS name     the full contents of the archive will be LISTED
